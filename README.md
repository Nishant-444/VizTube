## üöÄ Deployment

This application is **production-ready** and has been deployed on **Render**.

### Live API Endpoint

The live API is available at the following base URL. You can use this URL in Postman to interact with the deployed application:

**üåê Base URL:** `https://viztube.onrender.com`

### Environment Setup for Production

Before deploying, ensure you set the following environment variables on your hosting service:

- **`NODE_ENV`**: Set this to `production`. This is critical for performance and security optimizations in Express.
- **`CORS_ORIGIN`**: For security, change this from `*` to the specific domain of your frontend application (e.g., `https://my-viztube-frontend.com`).
- **Secrets**: Ensure all your `MONGODB_URI`, JWT secrets, and Cloudinary keys are securely set in the environment variables section of your deployment platform.

### Example: Deploying on Render

Render is a modern cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy Node.js applications directly from a GitHub repository.

1. **Push your code** to a GitHub repository.

2. **Create a New Web Service** on Render:

   - Log in to your Render account and click "New" ‚Üí "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub account and select your `viztube` repository

3. **Configure the Service**:

   - **Name**: Give your service a name (e.g., `viztube-api`)
   - **Region**: Choose a region close to your users
   - **Branch**: Select your main branch (e.g., `master` or `main`)
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `node index.js`

4. **Add Environment Variables**:

   - Go to the "Environment" tab
   - Add all the variables from your `.env` file one by one. This is a crucial step to ensure your application has access to its secrets.

5. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Create Web Service". Render will automatically pull your code, build the project, and deploy it.
   - Your API will be live at the URL provided by Render (e.g., `https://viztube-api.onrender.com`)

### Other Deployment Options

- **Heroku**: Easy deployment with Git integration
- **DigitalOcean**: VPS deployment with PM2
- **AWS**: EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk deployment
- **Vercel**: Serverless deployment option
